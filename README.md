# Huffman-Algorithm-Implementation
This is a Python based project to implement the Huffman Algorithm. 
Huffman algorithm is an encoding used to compress files. It is based on frequency of occurence of each character. In this project, I have demonstrated the working of the algorithm for text files.

To run the code:
1. Clone and download the zip file.
2. Go to the directory in which it is present: cd <dir name>
3. On the terminal, type cd Huffman-Algorithm-Implementation-master/
4. Run the code with the command: python sourceCode.py
  Make sure the file name is a text file and is present within the same directory as the code. A decompressed, encoded file will be created and its path will be returned to the user.
